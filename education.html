          My kindergarten was <strong> Tabika Kemas</strong>. This was my very first time stepping into the world of school. It was here that I learned so many new 
         things like writing, coloring, drawing, and more. It was also the first time I got to make friends and interact with kids my age.
         <br><br>
         Even though I don’t remember much from that time, I believe it were full and enjoyable during those years.

          My primary school was <strong>SK Puchong Batu 14</strong>. This was where I really started to grow academically. I learned a wide range of subjects like 
          Islamic Education, Physical Education, Arabic, and History. At first, it was a big change from kindergarten — I still remember staring at the wall clock,     
          hoping time would pass quickly because the lessons felt so long!
          <br><br>
          My school had two sessions: morning and afternoon. Students in Years 4, 5, and 6 attended in the morning from 7:30 a.m. to 1:00 p.m., while Years 1, 2, and 3   
          had classes in the afternoon from 1:30 p.m. to 6:30 p.m. Even so, I never had to worry about being late to school because the distance between my house and 
          the school was less than 50 meters. Yes — 50 meters! It sounds a bit crazy, but that’s the truth!
          <br><br>
          All in all, my experience in primary school was super fun and full of great memories. I honestly enjoyed every moment of it!

          My secondary school was <strong>SMK Puchong Batu 14</strong>.This was when I started focusing more on my academic achievements, hoping to become a better 
         student and make my parents proud. To be honest, there wasn't a huge difference between secondary school and primary school — except for having new friends     
         and teachers (well, that’s just my opinion).
         <br><br>
         I can't forget about my Form 4 and 5 moments, especially when I took new subjects like Household Science, where I learned how to cook and sew (I honestly   
         thought it was a bit funny for a guy to take this subject at first hehe..), and Agricultural Science, where I learned about planting and farming.
         Even though it was tough at first, those final two years became my favorite years in secondary school. I also made some amazing friends like Aiman, Farish,     
         Kimi, Farhan, and many more.
         <br><br>
         It’s these moments that made me realize how important it is to appreciate our time in school.
         (And yes... I really wish I had a time machine so I could go back to those days!)

        <td>
         I am currently continuing my studies at <strong>Universiti Teknologi MARA (UiTM)</strong>, Sungai Petani campus, pursuing a diploma in Library Informatics.
         At university, I can really feel a big difference compared to life in secondary school. On top of that, this is the first time in my life that I’m living far     
         away from my family — and to be honest, during the first week, I almost cried because I missed my family back in Selangor so much.        
       <br><br>
        But over time, I started getting used to life here. I learned how to be independent, and it’s also here where I met some amazing and funny friends like Amir, 
        Iqbal, Rifqie, fathi, hafizi, aiman and many more. University life has taught me a lot about the meaning of life. And even though it was tough in the   
        beginning, it’s actually been a really fun experience overall. (Time really flies I guess because you know what, I’m already in Semester 4 hehe...)
