    <h1>My Hobbies</h1>
    <p>I enjoy spending my free time doing things that make me happy and creative. One and my favorite hobbies is to playing video games!. For me, playing video games is one of the ways I escape from stress or the real world. It might sound a bit funny, but when I’m gaming, it feels like I’m in my own little world. Some of my favorite games are Mobile Legends, eFootball Mobile, and Fate/Grand Order.</p>

      <h2>Mobile Legends</h2>
      <p>
        Mobile Legends is one of my favorite games because of its fast-paced, strategic 5v5 gameplay. I usually play as a hyper or gold lane hero, and my top picks are   
        Joy, Granger, Harith, and Ling. Whether I'm pushing rank or just having fun with friends, the game always keeps me engaged. I enjoy the thrill of every match,    
        especially the intense team fights. The video below shows one of my gameplay sessions using Joy, one of my favorite heroes.

      <h2>eFootball Mobile</h2>
      <p>
        eFootball Mobile is my go-to football game. I love how realistic and competitive it feels, especially when building and customizing my dream team. Every match 
        is a chance to test my tactics and improve my skills. Climbing the ranks in online matches is always satisfying, and it keeps me motivated to keep playing. The    
        video below captures one of my matches where I put my strategy to the test.

      <h2>Fate/Grand Order</h2>
      <p>
        Fate/Grand Order is a game I truly enjoy for its deep storytelling and beautifully designed characters. I love collecting heroic servants and using them in 
        strategic, turn-based battles. Each servant has a unique backstory and personality, which makes the game feel like a rich anime experience. What keeps me    
        playing is the emotional, well-written story arcs. The video below showcases my gameplay during one of my favorite moments in the game.
