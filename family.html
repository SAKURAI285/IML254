        <h2>My Grandmother</h2>
        <p>My Grandmother name is <strong> Nismah Binti Said</strong>. She's someone that looks fierce outside but warm inside. She always gives me    
           motivation and also supports me financially. And the funny thing is, my siblings always say that I’m our grandma’s favorite grandchild. But honestly, I feel 
           like she treats all of us the same (well, that’s just my opinion though — I’m not sure what the other grandkids think).</p>

        <h2>My Father</h2>
        <p>My dad’s name is <strong> Izam Azali Bin Ishak</strong> and he’s 57 years old. He works as a teacher at a school Puchong Utama 2. He’s honestly such a funny   
           guy and always cracking jokes when we’re   feeling down. And yeah, we all enjoy being around him (even if his jokes can be kinda lame sometimes hehe..). You  
           probably wouldn’t guess it just by looking at him, but he’s actually the football team coach at his school right now.</p>

        <h2>My Mother</h2>
        <p>My mum’s name is <strong>Norhaslinda Binti Ibrahim</strong> and she’s 52 years old. She’s a teacher at a school at Taman Desaminium, but fun fact — she   
           actually used to teach me Malay back when I was in SK Puchong Batu 14! She really loves her kids a lot. I still remember when I was in Year 1, she took a 
           few months off just to stay with me in the hospital after I broke my arm. She’s also been a big help financially (along with my dad) while I’ve  
           been studying here.</p>

        <h2>My Older Sister</h2>
        <p>My sister’s name is <strong>Norfikriah Umaira Binti Izam Azali</strong> and she’s 25 years old. She works as an accountant at a company called Steel Recon 
           Industries. She absolutely loves food especially when it comes to desserts! On top of that, she’s a big fan of watching badminton matches (even though she’s    
           not exactly good at playing it herself). She’s also super into Korean dramas likes Missing the other side, mouse and Hotel De Luna.</p>

        <h2>My Younger Sister</h2>
        <p>My second sister’s name is <strong>Norhanis Madhihah Binti Izam Azali</strong> and she’s 21 years old. She's works at a Alpha Active Industries sdn.bhd.  
           She’s a super cheerful and funny person, though she  can be a little annoying sometimes. Still, she really loves both her younger siblings wich is me and 
           our little brother. Just like our eldest sister, she’s also really into Korean dramas.</p>

        <h2>My Younger Brother</h2>
        <p>My younger brother’s name is <strong> Muhammad Afif Zakwan Bin Izam Azali</strong> and he’s 16 years old. He goes to SMK Puchong Batu 14 which is the same 
           school I used to attend. He’s a pretty quiet person, or as people like to call it nowadays, an “introvert.” He’s also a hardcore gamer, especially when it  
           comes to Mobile Legends. Every time we meet our relatives, they always think he’s the older sibling and I’m the younger one, just because he’s taller than 
           me (he’s 168 cm while I’m only 158 cm). But still, he’s a little brother I really love and care about</p>
